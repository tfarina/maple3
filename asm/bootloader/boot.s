# If the bootloader signature bytes are 0x55aa, why are we swapping them down
# below? That is because x86 (the machine I'm coding this on) is little endian,
# so bytes get swapped in memory, and thus we have to invert and write them as
# 0xaa55. Otherwise, qemu gives the error "Boot failed: not a bootable disk".
